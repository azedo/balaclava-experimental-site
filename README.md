# Balaclava Experimental Site

Experimental site for the Brazilian studio balaclava (balaclavastudio.com.br) built with React.js.
The idea is to have windows showing the content as the user navigates de website.

## Roadmap
- ~~Create the windows in their default position;~~
- ~~Give the windows an active state, so they can always be on top;~~
- ~~Save the windows position locally based on the position of the window (in case of page reload);~~
- ~~Hide all the windows when needed (also use the saved position to restore the windows to their previous locations);~~
- When the user wants to see a gallery, hide the open windows that are not relevant to the chosen gallery, open the ones that are not open yet and re-arrange the windows (already open and recently open) in the screen;
- ~~Make windows (and possible other selected elements) draggable;~~
- ~~Minimize window (is it better or just close them?);~~
- Windows can have differente styles based on their content (or chosen by admin);
- Internacionalization of the site's content;
